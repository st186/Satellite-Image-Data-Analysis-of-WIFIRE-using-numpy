# Satellite-Image-Data-Analysis-of-WIFIRE-using-numpy
WIFIRE is an integrated system for wildfire analysis, with specific regard to changing urban dynamics and climate. The system integrates networked observations such as heterogeneous satellite data and real-time remote sensor data, with computational techniques in signal processing, visualization, modeling, and data assimilation to provide a scalable method to monitor such phenomena as weather patterns that can help predict a wildfire's rate of spread. You can read more about WIFIRE at: https://wifire.ucsd.edu/  In this example, we will analyze a sample satellite image dataset from WIFIRE using the numpy Library.
